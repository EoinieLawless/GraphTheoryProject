    "**What is Graph theory?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Graph theory** is a mathematical concept that deals with the study of graphs, which are mathematical structures that model relationships between objects. In computing, graph theory is used to represent and analyze data that can be represented as a graph, such as computer networks, social networks, and transportation networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "In simple terms, a graph is a collection of nodes (also called vertices) connected by edges. The edges represent the relationships between the nodes. Graph theory provides a set of tools and techniques to analyze these relationships and extract useful information from the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "Computing applications of graph theory include network analysis, optimization, routing, clustering, and data visualization. For example, graph theory can be used to find the shortest path between two nodes in a network, to identify clusters of nodes with similar characteristics, or to visualize complex data structures.\n",
