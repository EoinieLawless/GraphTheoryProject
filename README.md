Welcome to the Graph Isomorphism Project! This project aims to explore the problem of graph isomorphism and its importance in computer science and mathematics.

## Introduction

Graph isomorphism is the problem of determining whether two graphs are structurally identical. This problem has important applications in computer science, Chemistry, and other fields.

In this project, we will study the basics of graph theory, computational complexity, and algorithms used to solve the graph isomorphism problem.

## Contents

This project contains the following sections:

- **Graph Theory - Basics**: an introduction to the basic concepts and terminology of graph theory.
- **Graph Isomorphism**: an in-depth study of the problem of graph isomorphism and its computational complexity.
- **Importance of Graph Isomorphism Problem**: an exploration of the importance of graph isomorphism in computer science and other fields.
- **NP-intermediate**: a discussion of the relationship between graph isomorphism and other NP-intermediate problems.
- **Subgraph Isomorphism**: an introduction to the problem of subgraph isomorphism and its relationship to graph isomorphism.
- **Adjacency Matrices**: an explanation of adjacency matrices and their role in graph theory.
- **Permutations**: a study of permutations and their use in determining graph isomorphism.
